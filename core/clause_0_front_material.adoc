[big]*i.     Abstract*

This document is the specification for the core module of the OGC API - Joins standard. The core module specifies a service interface that allows attribute data to be joined either with collections that are hosted on the server or directly with inputted geojson files. The joining of the datasets is executed via common identifiers that are available in both datasets. The OGC API - Joins core module supports also operations for viewing metadata and key values on collections that are available on the server. It contains also operations for accessing, updating and deleting the created joinsd.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the OGC API - Joins standard. This draft is not complete and there are open issues that are still under discussion.
