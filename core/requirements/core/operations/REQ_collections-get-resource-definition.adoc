This schema is further constrained by the following requirements and recommendations.

To support hypermedia navigation, the `links` property must be populated with sufficient hyperlinks to navigate through the whole dataset.

^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/collections-get-success-links*
^|A |A `200`-response SHALL include the following <<link-relation-types,links>> in the `links` property of the response:

* A link to this response document (relation: `self`),

* A link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`).

^|B |All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.

Additional information may be available to assist in understanding and using this dataset. Links to those resources should be provided as well.

[[rec_core_collections-get-success-descriptions]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/collections-get-success-descriptions*
^|A |If external schemas or descriptions exist that provide additional information about the structure or semantics for the resource, a `200`-response SHOULD include links to each of those resources in the links property of the response (relation: `describedby`).

^|B |The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link. This applies to resources that describe the whole dataset.
|===

The `timeStamp` property of the Collections response indicates when the response was generated.

[[req_core_collections-get-success-timeStamp]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/collections-get-success-timeStamp*
^|A |If a property `timeStamp` is included in the response, the value SHALL be set to the time when the response was generated.
|===

The `collections` property of the Collections response provides a description of each individual collection hosted by the server. These descriptions are based on the <<collections_collectionid_schema, Collection Schema>>.

[[req_core_collections-get-success-items]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/collections-get-success-items*
^|A |For each dataset collection provided by the server, metadata describing that collection SHALL be provided in the `collections` property of the Collections response.
^|B |The content of that response SHALL comply with the requirements in the http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-common-2/1.0/rm/collection Requirements Class described in section `Collection Resource Definition` in the <<ogcapi-common-part2,OGC - API - Common: Part 2>> document).

^|*Permission {counter:per-id}* |*/per/core/collections-get-success-items*
^|A |To support servers with many collections, servers MAY limit the number of items in the property `collections`.

[[req_core_collections-get-success-items-links]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]

^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/collections-get-success-items-links*
^|A |For each collection resource included in the response, the `links` property of the collection SHALL include an item for each supported encoding with a link to the collection resource (relation: `dataset`).
^|B |All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` properties.
